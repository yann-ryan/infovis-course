## R and R-Studio

Throughout this course, we'll mostly work on visualizations and data using the programming language R. This will be done using R-Studio, an interface designed to make R easier to work with (known as an IDE).

For this course, the data, files, and interface are all already set up for you in a workspace on a service called 'Posit cloud'. Later on, you may want to install R and R-Studio on your local machine. See [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) for instructions on how to do this. The software is completely free and open-source.

### Logging into Posit Cloud and opening a notebook.

The first step is the create an account with Posit cloud. This is a service which will allow you to load R remotely, so you can complete this practical sessions for this course (you can also use R and R studio on your local machine if you use it already).

Sign up to Posit cloud with an email address here: <https://posit.cloud/plans>

Click on 'Learn more' under the Free plan, and then 'Sign up'.

Click on the invite link. Once you have signed up, click on the 'burger' icon to the left of 'Your Workspace' to open a sidebar, which will allow you to switch to the correct workspace 'Information Visualisation and the Humanities':

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-25%20at%2012.49.30.png)

Once you have switched, you'll see a list of assignments and projects. At the moment, there is just one for this week. Click the start button for 'Week 1: Introduction'.

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-25%20at%2012.50.09.png)

This will load, and you should shortly be greeted with the Rstudio interface -- this is an environment for creating and editing R code.

![](Screenshot%202022-09-27%20at%2012.50.25.png)

R-Studio is divided into four different sections, or *panes*. Each of these also has multiple tabs. Starting from the top-left (numbered 1):

1.  The source editor. Here is where you can edit R files such as RMarkdown or scripts.

2.  The environment pane will display any objects you create or import here, along with basic information on their type and size.

3.  This pane has a number of tabs. The default is files, which will show all the files in the current folder. You can use this to import or export additional files to R-Studio from your local machine.

4.  The console allows you to type and execute R commands directly: do this by typing here and pressing return.

All four of these panes are important and worth it's worth exploring more of the buttons and menu items. Throughout this course, you'll complete exercises by using the source editor to edit notebooks. As you execute code in these notebooks, you'll see objects pop into the environment pane. The console can be useful to test code that you don't want to keep in a document. Lastly, getting to know how to use and navigate the directory structure using the files pane is essential.

You can play around with the R-Studio interface. Don't worry about breaking anything, but you should regularly save your work.

## Your Derived Workspace

You can return to the workspace overview by clicking on the sidebar and on the 'Information Visualization\[...\]' menu item again.

If you do this, you'll see that there are now *two* workspace items. This is because when you started the workspace, it created a 'derived' version - meaning it has created a unique copy for you to work with, without changing the original one.

You can delete this version, copy it, or export a copy to your local machine. When you want to resume your work, you should open this copy. **Please note that as the instructor, I can see and edit all the derived workspaces.**

## R Markdown and 'Knitting' a Document

There are several ways to create and execute code within R studio, such as creating scripts or typing into the console (the bottom-left pane).

However, in this course, we'll exclusively use one method: R Markdown notebooks.

These are special documents which can include code and text. Text is written using a simple format called Markdown, and code goes into special 'cells' within the document. Once you're finished, you'll tell R studio to execute all the code in the document and render it as an html file. This process is called 'knitting'.

We'll worry more about code next week, but for now, let's just get used to creating R Markdown files, knitting them, and downloading them to your local machine so they can be sent as assignments.

### Create a new markdown file

Click file -\> new file -\> R notebook.

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-25%20at%2012.51.20.png)

This will open a markdown notebook in the top-left pane. If asked to install packages, just click yes, and wait a little longer.

A notebook will now be open in your screen. This is where you can type text and code.

At the moment, there is some sample text and code in the document.

At the top of the document is some formatted text which looks like this:

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-25%20at%2012.53.35.png)

This is called a yaml header. It contains information about your document, and it needs to remain here for the notebook to work. You can use this yaml header to edit the title of your report: just edit the text within the quotation marks which now reads 'R Notebook'.

You should delete the rest of the text in the document: highlight and delete the rest of the contents of the notebook, using delete/backspace.

### Type some text

Type some text. There are two ways of doing this. You can use the source editor, which is the default view. You can switch between Source and Visual using the button above.

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-25%20at%2012.55.20.png)

In the source editor, use markdown. This is a very simple coding language used to render text on the internet. There are codes for bold, italics, headings. You can add images etc. You can switch between the two at any time.

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-25%20at%2012.56.52.png)

In the visual editor, use the menu items to format your text. For example bold, italics, headings. You can use the drop-down menu to add images, tables, and so forth, as you would with word processor software such as Word or Google docs.

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-25%20at%2012.56.33.png)

### Save the file

In order to render/knit the file, it needs to be saved first.

Click file, save, and give it a name.

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-25%20at%2012.57.40.png)

#### Naming conventions.

In this course, you will be required to use good naming conventions. Save the file with an appropriate name which communicates the most important information about the file: who created it, and what it contains.

Once you have done this, you'll see a new .Rmd file appear in the file browser, in the bottom-right pane:

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-25%20at%2012.58.28.png)

### Knit the document

Now, we'll render the document. When a document is rendered, it restarts the R engine, runs through the code, and outputs the document. In this case, it will be very quick, as we haven't written any code.

Click the drop-down where it currently says 'Preview', and then 'render HTML'. This will create a new file in your folder.

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-25%20at%2012.59.37.png)

The knitted html file will preview in a new window. You can close this.

More importantly, there are now a total of three additional files in the file browser:

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-25%20at%2013.00.52.png){width="600"}

-   The file ending in .html is the knitted output of the markdown.

-   The file ending in .Rmd is the 'source code' of the final file.

-   The file ending in nb.html is created for making a quick preview, and can be ignored.

### Download and save the file

To submit R Markdown files as assignments in Brightspace, you'll need to download both the html output and the 'raw' markdown file to your local machine, and turn them both into a .zip file first.

Click on the checkbox for both the html and the .Rmd file.

Click on the 'More' dropdown menu, and then 'Export'

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-25%20at%2013.02.31.png){width="600"}

If you have correctly selected more than one file, Posit cloud will automatically create a .zip file and download it. Save it with a sensible name, and then you can upload this zip directly to Brightspace.

**This is the format we will use for every assignment, so it's worth getting the hang of it!**

### Upload to Brightspace

Upload the .zip file to Brightspace in the assignment area.

## Adding Code

To add a code block, use the menu items.

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-25%20at%2013.05.07.png){width="600"}

This will add a shaded area to your markdown file, called a 'code cell'.

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-25%20at%2013.05.31.png){width="600"}

Add the simple code, 1 + 1. This will simply tell R to add these two numbers together.

First, execute the code from the cell, without knitting the document. Click on the green triangle in the top-right of the code cell. You'll see that the output (2) appears below the cell.

![](images/Screenshot%202023-08-25%20at%2013.07.20.png){width="600"}

This is the code output. This output can be anything that we make in code, such as a visualisation. This is what makes R markdown such a great tool creating data visualisation reports. We can easily write up text and findings, and publish them alongside code results, tables, visualisations, even interactive maps.

Next, render/knit the document as in the last step. The document will knit again. Look at the html file, and you'll see that the code is displayed, and the code result - the output - is displayed underneath.

## Adding files

The last thing we'll do is practise adding files to the Rstudio area. Most times, you'll need to upload files to your workspace in order to work with them. First, you'll up load them to the workspace, and second, you'll read them into R.

You could also upload other files, for example if your final project markdown includes some images not generated by code.

We'll practice this by downloading a file from Brightspace, and uploading it to Posit Cloud. This file can be found under the 'Files' area on the course site. Download the file 'box_office' to your local machine first.

To upload a file to Posit cloud, look at the file manager in the bottom-right pane. Click on 'Upload', and then browse to the file on your computer, and click OK. You'll see the file appear in the file browser in a moment.

## First weekly task: identify a data source

To practice creating and submitting R markdown documents, I would like you to write a very short report (50-100 words). You should spend thirty minutes to a maximum of one hour on this.

For this report, you're asked to identify a dataset or data source you'd like to work with over the rest of the course. Ideally, this should be something you are interested in and have some existing knowledge of - this will make your life much easier later.

Some examples are here:

-   [UN Data](http://data.un.org/): The portal for all sorts of United Nations macro-scale data.

-   [UNHCR Refugee Data Finder](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/). A recent favourite of mine, this resource contains data on displaced persons and flows from 1962 to 2022. It's also available as a [package for R](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/insights/explainers/refugees-r-package.html), making it very easy to work with (I can help with this).

-   [Rainbow Map](https://www.rainbow-europe.org/): data on the legal status and social climate for LGBTI people in Europe (click download data button).

-   [Overheid.nl](https://data.overheid.nl/en): Portal contain thousands of datasets published and shared by the Dutch government.

-   [IATI Registry:](https://www.iatiregistry.org/dataset) A portal where major developmental NGOs provide information on the projects they undertake in as transparent a way as possible.

-   [Natural Earth](http://naturalearthdata.com/): Free raster and vector maps, including info on borders, names, and basic statistics. This is also available as a package in R.

-   [SEDAC](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/): NASA's Socio-Economic Data and Applications Center

-   [European Data Portal](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/en/homepage): A portal that collects even more data from across the Public Sector in Europe.

-   [DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/search): The KNAW's (Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen) data repository curating more than 200.000 data-sets based on (Dutch) academic research.

-   [The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database](http://www.slavevoyages.org/): A specific data-set focused on the records of 36.000 slaving voyages.

-   [Connected Histories](http://www.connectedhistories.org/): integrated search for British history sources from 1500-1900, including Old Bailey Online, the Digital Panopticon, and many more.

-   [Climatological Database of the World's Oceans](https://www.historicalclimatology.com/cliwoc.html): dataset containing position and weather information from over 280,000 ship's logbooks, dating from 1750 - 1850. Not only useful for climate research but an interesting geographical and historical dataset too!

-   [Delpher](https://www.delpher.nl/): Over 100 million digitized Dutch newspaper pages.

-   [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/): It's both a large collection as well as a collection of large networks! 

-   [KONECT](http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/): Another network collection (also large, not all of which are large networks) from the university of Koblenz.

-   [Data.World](https://data.world/): A commercial platform that hosts a large collection of data-sets on various sources. Not all data are open, however, and a sign-up is required.

You don't need to stick to this data source if you realise it's not suitable later.

Once you have identified your dataset (or general data source), open Posit cloud and create a new R markdown document. Write up a very short description of the data, including:

-   The name and url to the data - how do you access it?

-   Why you would like to work with it

-   What stories you think you could tell with it

-   Any potential problems that might occur, such as needing extensive cleaning, or issues with access.

The report should have a custom title and should contain at least **4 different markdown features**, such as:

-   Multiple section and sub-section headers.

-   Text in bold/italics

-   An image, such as a screenshot, or an example of the kind of visualisation you would like to create. To add images, you'll first need to upload them to your workspace. You can do this using the 'Upload' button in the bottom-right pane (the file browser).

-   Some text with a hyperlink.

-   Bullet points

-   A table

When you're finished, download the .Rmd and the html, making sure it is a single .zip file. Rename this .zip file so that it begins with your surname, and upload it to Brightspace, under 'Week 1: Create and submit an R Markdown document'.

Finally, **close the Posit Cloud workspace.**
