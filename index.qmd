# Course Overview {.unnumbered}

Welcome! You're probably here because you are taking the course *Information Visualization and the Humanities,* taking place in Semester 1, 2023-2024, at Leiden University. It's part of the minor in Digital Humanities. The course instructor is Dr. Yann Ryan.

This e-book will serve as the course website. The menu on the left side lists the chapters, one for each week of the course. More will appear as the course progresses. The menu on the right contains the table of contents for this particular chapter, so you can skip to different sections.

You'll also need to familiarise yourself with the course [Brightspace area](https://brightspace.universiteitleiden.nl/d2l/home/250614), where I'll put further information and you'll submit assignments.

## What do we mean by 'information visualisation'?

Information visualization (or data visualization, which I'll use interchangeablely) could be defined as ***the graphical representation of information and data***.

Data visualization is often used to convey or communicate messages about complex or large-scale data. It has been around in its present form---charts, graphs and so forth---since at least the eighteenth century. One form of data visualisation---maps---have been around for even longer. Today, we come across data visualizations in our daily lives: in everything from scientific articles to news media, and in advertisements.

In the humanities, the data we use might be, for example, historical statistics or networks, or the text (or data derived from it) found in literary works. It might be something totally different such as audio, images, or spatial data.

## Course Aims and Objectives

-   Be able to articulate how to leverage info visualization to provide an edge in a range of situations, including academic research as well as non-academic professions.

-   Understand how a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) approach to data is important for your work and that of others.

-   Be able to critically reflect on a range of visualizations, with a specific focus on network and spatial data.

-   Know where to find some of the inspiring visualizations, thinkers, and designers in this field.

-   Be able to discuss your views on information visualization with peers as well as give and receive feedback.

-   Be able to use a number of information visualization tools, such as network analytic and GIS software or interactive visualization tools.

In terms of concrete skills, by the end of this course, you should be able to use humanities-focused data to make informative, highly-customised visualisations such as this:

```

Perhaps most importantly, you will have total control over every aspect of the visualisation, from the colours, to the titles, labels, and scales. You'll even be able to publish them in a smart-looking report, which will look a bit like this page.

### Information Visualisation...

Most importantly, you'll learn the basic principles of information visualization, and put them into practice using a platform called R (more on that below). R is widely used by, for example, data journalists at publications like *The Economist* and the *Financial Times.*

The visualisations above were made with a few lines of the R language. If you click the 'Show the code' button above them, you'll see the code I used to create them. It might look a little complicated now, but if you follow the course, you should be able to make similar (and hopefully much nicer) ones by the end of the twelve weeks.

In your final project, you'll combine text, data and visual outputs to make a *report* on a topic you're interested in. You'll make a document like this. For this course, it's more than enough to stick to the basic charts like the above. But if you're interested, you can explore fancier things such as interactive maps and charts, 3D-rendered visualisations, and more.

### ...and the Humanities

This is not to say the course will be an exhaustive 'how to' for scientific data visualisations. One of your superpowers as a humanities student is that you learn to to move beyond the surface level and consider the subtexts, biases, and so forth in cultural objects. In this course, we'll put those skills to good use, and you'll use your own expertise and interests to tell compelling and truthful stories about humanities subjects, using data.

Just as importantly, you'll learn how to critique data visualisations and design. As a group we'll ask: what makes them good or bad, scientific or unethical? Can we trust the intentions behind commercial or political data visualisations? Can we spot when they are being misleading, and describe exactly *how*? What are the negative and positive connotations around certain graphical representations, and why do we use them? How can we make better, more ethical data visualisations? How can we make visualisations which properly consider those with accessibility needs?

## Schedule

Below is the course schedule. In the first couple of weeks, you'll learn the basics of the R platform, and the practical steps of how to use it for data wrangling and to produce visualisations. We'll first work with 'dummy' data, while you think about how you can use your own interests and expertise, and find the data you'd like to use for the rest of the course.

After this, we'll do things in a slightly unconventional order. Week 4 is a 'field trip' to the Library, where you'll learn about maps from a traditional, humanities perspective from the curator of maps, Martijn Storms.

So we can use and think about the themes of Martijn's lecture, after this we'll jump straight into a section on digital mapping. You'll learn how to create your own maps from scratch, and how to critique existing ones and those of your peers. Through maps, we'll learn some more about key information visualisation concepts, such colour theory.

After this, we'll go back to learning about conventional data visualisations, followed by a section on networks. In the final weeks of the course, we'll learn about putting the finishing touches on your work, talk about the final project, and there will be some space for you to do some experiments in some additional areas of interest.

## Data Visualisation

In practice, creating data visualisations involves mapping numerical data of some sort to graphical representations - often called geometries. A geometry might be the length of a line, the x and y position on a graph, or the temperature of a colour on a map. A good data visualisation will use this mapping to tell a story about the data, while representing it faithfully.

You'll put these skills into practice using a tool called R. R is a coding language often used for data science - it's particularly good at working with what are called 'dataframes': structured data in the form of rows and columns which we'll mostly be using on this course.

To work with R, we have set up a learning environment called 'Posit cloud'. Later, you'll be given instructions on how to sign up and access your workspace.

Each assignment (including the final project) will be submitted in the form of a report. This is a html document (a web page) containing visualisations and text.

Using a coding language like this allows us to have direct control over every aspect of a visualisation - we can choose from many different geometries depending on our data and what we want to show, adjust the colours in precise ways, and pick the scale we want to use. We can also use R to summarise data, or limit it to just the parts we want to work with. This will complement the learning of Python you're doing in your other course.

In this course, you'll learn these very practical skills. It might be hard-going or frustrating at first, but it is very worthwhile. Skills in R or any other programming language are very valuable to all sorts of employers.

At the same time, there is one important thing to note:

**Your grade for any assessment will never be dependent on your coding ability.**

This is not a coding course: some of you may pick it up straight away, and others may stay at a basic level throughout the course. That is completely fine. You are welcome to ask for help from me, your peers, and online. You can even ask a chatbot for coding help, if you like. In all your assessments, I'll take into account your understanding of data science and visualisations on a more fundamental, humanities-led level.

It's easy to get stuck or lost in assignments. When you're learning a new skill like coding, you can spend many hours agonising over what might turn out to be a simple problem when it's explained to you.

The key is to stick strictly to the number of hours given to each assignment - don't waste lots of time working out what might turn out to be a small mistake.

## Course Load

Total course load 5 EC x 28 hours = 140 hours:

-   Seminar: 13 x 2 (26 hours)

-   Course readings and coding practice (34 hours)

-   Assignment(s): (35 hours)

-   Peer Feedback: (5 hours)

-   Final project/paper: (40 hours)

## Grading

-   Assignments: 40 percent

-   Class Participation & Peer Feedback: 20 percent

-   Final project: 40 percent

## Reading

Each week will have one piece of assigned reading. The reading should be done **before** the week in question, e.g. Joanna Drucker should be read before our class in week 2. Some of these readings will be very practical, and others will be more abstract or conceptual.

The first 20 minutes of each class will involve a discussion on the reading. To facilitate this, I ask you to have prepared **one question** for each piece of reading, to show your engagement with the text.

## The Fine Print

**Attendance** is required. If you know you will need to miss a class, please indicate this at least two weeks prior. If you know beforehand you will have to miss three or more classes, you cannot take this course. If you miss a class due to sickness or other unforeseen circumstances, please notify me without delay.

Class **participation** is part of your final grade. Participation is evaluated both on attendance and on the quality of feedback given to the work of other students. Aside from participation being part of your grade, I really **appreciate your** **input**. If you think you have something to ask, please speak up: there *are* no stupid questions, but there are a lot of lost opportunities for information exchange and learning. This field is full of exciting new ideas and developments and it is impossible to be aware of them all. So, if you can share information on an idea, article, project, or tool that is of you value to you, please do!

If you need to speak to me, I'm happy to arrange a meeting to discuss any issues or problems you encounter on the course. Ideally, send a request a week in advance, via email. The meetings will probably take place in the meeting rooms in the top floor of the Arsenaal building.

**Plagiarism**: If you have not done so already, please inform yourself on Leiden University's views and regulations on [plagiarism](https://www.organisatiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/binaries/content/assets/ul2student/reglementen/gedragscode-plagiaat-universiteit-leiden-eng--cvb.docx). This Leiden university library [portal](https://www.library.universiteitleiden.nl/students/citing) has several accessible web courses on how to quote and cite right and tips for bibliographic management. Note that plagiarism, copyright and other information sharing or copying issues are often extra complex when dealing with digital sources. If you are still in doubt whether (parts of) any work for this course may constitute plagiarism, you need to signal and verify this with me before you hand it in for grading.

### Use of Chatbots for assignments

GPT-based chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google Bard are not banned outright but should be used with extreme caution. Due to the nature of this course, chatbot-generated text is unlikely to be of much use as you will be responding to your own visual work and that of your peers.

Chatbot-generated text will be treated as any other anonymous, secondary author. In terms of this course, its outputs are not considered reliable, verifiable information. **You can quote or make reference to generated text as long as you cite it as a source (though I do not advise doing this because of the tendency to 'hallucinations'). However you must not pass it off as your own original work: this will be treated as plagiarism.** Extensive quoting, even if cited, will negatively impact your grade.

One exception to this is in coding: for any of your assignments, you are free to use and submit code from prompts given to ChatGPT or similar applications.

If you do use the output from a chatbot in any of your assignments, either for code help or other purposes, make a note of this in your submitted markdown documents, as a footnote.
