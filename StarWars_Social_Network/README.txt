This dataset contains two folders:


#Gabasova 2016:

This folder contains code and data used by Gabasova (2016) to create a Star Wars social network, taken from GitHub:

https://github.com/evelinag/StarWars-social-network

@misc{gabasova_star_wars_2016,
  author  = {Evelina Gabasova},
  title   = {{Star Wars social network}},
  year    = 2016,
  url     = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1411479},
  doi     = {10.5281/zenodo.1411479}
 }


#json_to_csv:

Because Gabasova's (2016) network data is in json format and this wasn't discussed in detail in class, I have processed the json files into two csv files: one node list and one edge list. For all json files in Gabasova's data/network folder, the json_to_csv folder contains those two files.
The folder additionally contains the Python script with which the data were processed.
