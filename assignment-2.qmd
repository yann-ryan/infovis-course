title: "Assignment 2: Make a map"
---

## Goal

For this assignment, make either a choropleth or points map. This map should visualise some aspect of your chosen dataset, using aesthetics such as color, size and shape (depending on your map type).

The map should be readable and you should make design choices to improve it where possible.

For this assignment you will hand in, in one zip file via Brightspace:

-   A visualization, in the form of a markdown report, containing the final map and code

-   A report (500 words max) providing information on the map's design decisions made, referring to Chapter 4 of Meirelles'Â *Design for Information* and Chapter 15 of Claus Wilke's *Data Visualization* where appropriate. You will conclude the report by mentioning any challenges encountered (if any) and providing a project timetable.

-   You should return both the .Rmd file and the HTML file in your .zip file.

## Deadline

The deadline to hand up this assignment is **11 December, at 09.00.**

## Tips

Look back over the previous weeks to find relevant code to complete the exercise. Pay particular attention to the method for joining your dataset up to a basemap from RNaturalEarth, if you're making a choropleth map.

## Datasets

You are welcome to use any spatial dataset you like, but here are some options if you don't have something in mind:

-   The [Presidential Gifts dataset](https://infovis.lucdh.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GiftToThePresidentsV3.zip)

-   The Nobel Prize dataset (the code to download this can be found in the course book, for example in Digital Mapping 3).

-   People map of the UK ([explanation here](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/people-map-uk))

-   [ICE facilities in the US](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/blob/master/book/data/ICE-facilities.csv) (from the [Torn Apart/Separados project](https://xpmethod.columbia.edu/torn-apart/volume/1/))

-   [Historical letter data](https://github.com/humanitiesplusdesign/palladio-app/tree/main/sample%20data). To use this, you would need to join the 'Letters' or 'People' data to the 'Cities' dataset, in order to join coordinates to data.

-   The ['members' dataset](https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/about/data/) from the[Shakespeare and Co project](https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/), which lists the addresses of members of the famous bookshop and lending library in Paris. If you'd like to use this, you'll probably need a basemap which is at the 'zoom' level of a single city (Paris). Get in touch and I can help with this!

-   You can also make your own dataset, using a geocoder, a gazetteer, or looking up coordinates manually.
